Image ROI(Region of Interest)

Sometimes, you will have to play with certain regions of images. For eye detection in images, first face detection is done over the entire image. When a face is obtained, we select the face region alone and search for eyes ðŸ‘€ inside it instead of searching the whole image. It improves accuracy (because eyes are always on faces ðŸ¥² ) and performance (because we search in a small area).
